# Chapter 0: Setup

For now, I will defer to the installation instructions on SDL's page itself:
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

Now I assume that you have followed that and now have a `main.cpp` C++ file that compiles and links against SDL3.

I will use CMake for this guide, as it is what SDL itself uses.
It also ensures the best cross-platform and cross-editor functionality.
